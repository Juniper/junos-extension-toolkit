JET API IDL package
===================

Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET), an evolution of the Junos SDK, provides a
modern, programmatic interface for developers of third-party applications on
Junos devices. It focuses on providing a standards-based interface to JUNOS
for customizing management and control plane functionality.

JET uses gRPC ( http://www.grpc.io/ ) to enable request-response service across
different languages and platforms. gRPC by default uses Protocol Buffers
( https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/ ) as the Interface Definition
Language (IDL) for describing service interface and structure of the messages.

This package contains IDL(proto) files for various services supported in JUNOS.
Protobuf compiler can be used to compile the IDL files provided in this package
to generate client and server stubs in several languages.

Example:-
Python client stubs generation for Management IDL (jnx_management_service.proto)
provided in this package, you can try the following command:
"$ python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./2 --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=.
 2/jnx_management_service.proto"
More detailed documentation on different languages and options can be found in
the above references links for gRPC and Protocol Buffers.
